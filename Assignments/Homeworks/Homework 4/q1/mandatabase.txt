NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       List  information  about  the FILEs (the current directory by default).
       Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort  is  speci‐
       fied.

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options
       too.

       -a, --all
              do not ignore entries starting with .

       -A, --almost-all
              do not list implied . and ..

       --author
              with -l, print the author of each file

       -b, --escape
              print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters

       --block-size=SIZE
              scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g., '--block-size=M'
              prints sizes in units of 1,048,576 bytes; see SIZE format below

       -B, --ignore-backups
              do not list implied entries ending with ~

       -c     with -lt: sort by, and show, ctime (time of last modification of
              file status information); with -l: show ctime and sort by  name;
              otherwise: sort by ctime, newest first

       -C     list entries by columns

       --color[=WHEN]
              colorize  the  output;  WHEN can be 'never', 'auto', or 'always'
              (the default); more info below

              list directories themselves, not their contents

       -D, --dired
              generate output designed for Emacs' dired mode

       --group-directories-first
              group directories before files;

              can   be  augmented  with  a  --sort  option,  but  any  use  of
              --sort=none (-U) disables grouping

       -G, --no-group
              in a long listing, don't print group names

              default to 1024-byte blocks for disk usage

       -l     use a long listing format

       -L, --dereference
              when showing file information for a symbolic link, show informa‐

              version (-v), extension (-X)

       --time=WORD
              with -l, show time as WORD instead of default modification time:
              atime or access or use (-u) ctime or status (-c); also use spec‐
              ified time as sort key if --sort=time

       --time-style=STYLE
              with -l, show times using style STYLE: full-iso, long-iso,  iso,
              locale,  or  +FORMAT;  FORMAT  is interpreted like in 'date'; if
              FORMAT  is  FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2,  then  FORMAT1  applies  to
              non-recent  files  and FORMAT2 to recent files; if STYLE is pre‐
              fixed with 'posix-', STYLE takes effect only outside  the  POSIX
              locale

       -t     sort by modification time, newest first

       -T, --tabsize=COLS
              assume tab stops at each COLS instead of 8

       -u     with  -lt:  sort by, and show, access time; with -l: show access

       -x     list entries by lines instead of by columns

       -X     sort alphabetically by entry extension

       -1     list one file per line

       SELinux options:

       --lcontext
              Display security context.   Enable -l. Lines  will  probably  be
              too wide for most displays.

       -Z, --context
              Display  security context so it fits on most displays.  Displays
              only mode, user, group, security context and file name.

       --scontext
              Display only security context and file name.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       SIZE is an integer and optional unit (example:  10M  is  10*1024*1024).
       Units  are K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y (powers of 1024) or KB, MB, ... (pow‐
       ers of 1000).

       Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by  default  and
       with  --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when
       standard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS  environment
       variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.

   Exit status:
       0      if OK,

       1      if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),

       2      if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

SED(1)                           User Commands                          SED(1)



NAME
       sed - stream editor for filtering and transforming text

SYNOPSIS
       sed [OPTION]... {script-only-if-no-other-script} [input-file]...

DESCRIPTION
       Sed  is a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text
       transformations on an input stream (a file or input from  a  pipeline).
       While  in  some  ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits
       (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s),  and
       is consequently more efficient.  But it is sed's ability to filter text
       in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other  types  of
       editors.

       -n, --quiet, --silent

              suppress automatic printing of pattern space

       -e script, --expression=script

              add the script to the commands to be executed

       -f script-file, --file=script-file

              add the contents of script-file to the commands to be executed

       --follow-symlinks

              follow symlinks when processing in place

       -i[SUFFIX], --in-place[=SUFFIX]

              edit files in place (makes backup if SUFFIX supplied)

       -c, --copy

              use copy instead of rename when shuffling files in -i mode

       -b, --binary

              does  nothing;  for  compatibility with WIN32/CYGWIN/MSDOS/EMX (
              open files in binary mode (CR+LFs are not treated specially))

       -l N, --line-length=N

              specify the desired line-wrap length for the `l' command

       --posix

              disable all GNU extensions.

       -r, --regexp-extended

              use extended regular expressions in the script.

       -s, --separate

              consider files as separate rather than as  a  single  continuous
              long stream.

       -u, --unbuffered

              load  minimal amounts of data from the input files and flush the
              output buffers more often

       -z, --null-data

              separate lines by NUL characters

       --help

              display this help and exit

       --version

              output version information and exit

       If no -e, --expression, -f, or --file option is given, then  the  first
       non-option  argument  is  taken  as  the  sed script to interpret.  All
       remaining arguments are names of input files; if  no  input  files  are
       specified, then the standard input is read.

COMMAND SYNOPSIS
       This is just a brief synopsis of sed commands to serve as a reminder to
       those  who  already  know sed; other documentation (such as the texinfo
       document) must be consulted for fuller descriptions.

   Zero-address ``commands''
       : label
              Label for b and t commands.

       #comment
              The comment extends until the next newline (or the end of  a  -e
              script fragment).

       }      The closing bracket of a { } block.

   Zero- or One- address commands
       =      Print the current line number.

       a \

       text   Append text, which has each embedded newline preceded by a back‐
              slash.

       i \

       text   Insert text, which has each embedded newline preceded by a back‐
              slash.

       q [exit-code]
              Immediately  quit  the  sed  script  without processing any more
              input, except that if auto-print is  not  disabled  the  current
              pattern  space will be printed.  The exit code argument is a GNU
              extension.

       Q [exit-code]
              Immediately quit the sed  script  without  processing  any  more
              input.  This is a GNU extension.

       r filename
              Append text read from filename.

       R filename
              Append  a  line read from filename.  Each invocation of the com‐
              mand reads a line from the file.  This is a GNU extension.

   Commands which accept address ranges
       {      Begin a block of commands (end with a }).

       b label
              Branch to label; if label is omitted, branch to end of script.

       c \

       text   Replace the selected lines with text, which  has  each  embedded
              newline preceded by a backslash.

       d      Delete pattern space.  Start next cycle.

       D      If  pattern  space contains no newline, start a normal new cycle
              as if the d command was issued.  Otherwise, delete text  in  the
              pattern  space  up  to the first newline, and restart cycle with
              the resultant pattern space,  without  reading  a  new  line  of
              input.

       h H    Copy/append pattern space to hold space.

       g G    Copy/append hold space to pattern space.

       l      List out the current line in a ``visually unambiguous'' form.

       l width
              List  out  the  current line in a ``visually unambiguous'' form,
              breaking it at width characters.  This is a GNU extension.

       n N    Read/append the next line of input into the pattern space.

       p      Print the current pattern space.

       P      Print up to the first embedded newline of  the  current  pattern
              space.

       s/regexp/replacement/
              Attempt  to match regexp against the pattern space.  If success‐
              ful,  replace  that  portion  matched  with  replacement.    The
              replacement may contain the special character & to refer to that
              portion of the pattern space  which  matched,  and  the  special
              escapes  \1  through  \9  to refer to the corresponding matching
              sub-expressions in the regexp.

       t label
              If a s/// has done a  successful  substitution  since  the  last
              input  line  was  read  and  since the last t or T command, then
              branch to label; if label is omitted, branch to end of script.

       T label
              If no s/// has done a successful  substitution  since  the  last
              input  line  was  read  and  since the last t or T command, then
              branch to label; if label is omitted, branch to end  of  script.
              This is a GNU extension.

       w filename
              Write the current pattern space to filename.

       W filename
              Write  the  first line of the current pattern space to filename.
              This is a GNU extension.

       x      Exchange the contents of the hold and pattern spaces.

       y/source/dest/
              Transliterate the characters in the pattern space  which  appear
              in source to the corresponding character in dest.

Addresses
       Sed  commands can be given with no addresses, in which case the command
       will be executed for all input lines; with one address, in  which  case
       the  command  will  only  be  executed for input lines which match that
       address; or with two addresses, in which case the command will be  exe‐
       cuted  for  all  input  lines  which match the inclusive range of lines
       starting from the first address and continuing to the  second  address.
       Three  things  to  note about address ranges: the syntax is addr1,addr2
       (i.e., the addresses are separated by a comma); the  line  which  addr1
       matched will always be accepted, even if addr2 selects an earlier line;
       and if addr2 is a regexp, it will not be tested against the  line  that
       addr1 matched.

       After  the address (or address-range), and before the command, a !  may
       be inserted, which specifies that the command shall only be executed if
       the address (or address-range) does not match.

       The following address types are supported:

       number Match  only  the specified line number (which increments cumula‐
              tively across files, unless the -s option is  specified  on  the
              command line).

       first~step
              Match every step'th line starting with line first.  For example,
              ``sed -n 1~2p'' will print all the  odd-numbered  lines  in  the
              input  stream,  and the address 2~5 will match every fifth line,
              starting with the second.  first can be zero; in this case,  sed
              operates as if it were equal to step.  (This is an extension.)

       $      Match the last line.

       /regexp/
              Match lines matching the regular expression regexp.

       \cregexpc
              Match  lines  matching the regular expression regexp.  The c may
              be any character.

       GNU sed also supports some special 2-address forms:

       0,addr2
              Start out in "matched  first  address"  state,  until  addr2  is
              found.  This is similar to 1,addr2, except that if addr2 matches
              the very first line of input the 0,addr2 form will be at the end
              of  its  range,  whereas  the  1,addr2 form will still be at the
              beginning of its range.  This works only when addr2 is a regular
              expression.

       addr1,+N
              Will match addr1 and the N lines following addr1.

       addr1,~N
              Will  match  addr1  and the lines following addr1 until the next
              line whose input line number is a multiple of N.

REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
       POSIX.2 BREs should be supported, but they aren't completely because of
       performance  problems.  The \n sequence in a regular expression matches
       the newline character, and similarly for \a, \t, and other sequences.

NAME
       rm - remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS
       rm [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents  the  GNU version of rm.  rm removes each
       specified file.  By default, it does not remove directories.

       If the -I or --interactive=once option is given,  and  there  are  more
       than  three  files  or  the  -r,  -R, or --recursive are given, then rm
       prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire operation.   If
       the response is not affirmative, the entire command is aborted.

       Otherwise,  if  a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and
       the -f or --force  option  is  not  given,  or  the  -i  or  --interac‐
       tive=always  option is given, rm prompts the user for whether to remove
       the file.  If the response is not affirmative, the file is skipped.

OPTIONS
       Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

       -f, --force
              ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt

       -i     prompt before every removal

       -I     prompt once before removing  more  than  three  files,  or  when
              removing recursively; less intrusive than -i, while still giving
              protection against most mistakes

       --interactive[=WHEN]
              prompt according to WHEN: never,  once  (-I),  or  always  (-i);
              without WHEN, prompt always

       --one-file-system
              when  removing  a hierarchy recursively, skip any directory that
              is on a file system different from  that  of  the  corresponding
              command line argument

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially

       --preserve-root
              do not remove '/' (default)

       -r, -R, --recursive
              remove directories and their contents recursively

       -d, --dir
              remove empty directories

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By default, rm does not remove directories.  Use the --recursive (-r or
       -R) option to remove each listed directory, too, along with all of  its
       contents.

       To  remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example '-foo', use
       one of these commands:

              rm -- -foo

              rm ./-foo

       Note that if you use rm to remove a  file,  it  might  be  possible  to
       recover  some  of its contents, given sufficient expertise and/or time.
       For greater assurance that the contents are truly  unrecoverable,  con‐
       sider using shred.

NAME
       cp - copy files and directories

SYNOPSIS
       cp [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
       cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
       cp [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...

DESCRIPTION
       Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options
       too.

       -a, --archive
              same as -dR --preserve=all

       --attributes-only
              don't copy the file data, just the attributes

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       --copy-contents
              copy contents of special files when recursive

       -d     same as --no-dereference --preserve=links

       -f, --force
              if an existing destination file cannot be opened, remove it  and
              try  again  (this  option  is ignored when the -n option is also
              used)

       -i, --interactive
              prompt before overwrite (overrides a previous -n option)

       -H     follow command-line symbolic links in SOURCE

       -l, --link
              hard link files instead of copying

       -L, --dereference
              always follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -n, --no-clobber
              do not overwrite an  existing  file  (overrides  a  previous  -i
              option)

       -P, --no-dereference
              never follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -p     same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps

       --preserve[=ATTR_LIST]
              preserve the specified attributes (default: mode,ownership,time‐
              stamps), if  possible  additional  attributes:  context,  links,
              xattr, all

       -c     deprecated, same as --preserve=context

       --no-preserve=ATTR_LIST
              don't preserve the specified attributes

       --parents
              use full source file name under DIRECTORY

       -R, -r, --recursive
              copy directories recursively

       --reflink[=WHEN]
              control clone/CoW copies. See below

       --remove-destination
              remove  each existing destination file before attempting to open
              it (contrast with --force)

       --sparse=WHEN
              control creation of sparse files. See below

       --strip-trailing-slashes
              remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE argument

       -s, --symbolic-link
              make symbolic links instead of copying

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
              override the usual backup suffix

       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              copy all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY

       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat DEST as a normal file

       -u, --update
              copy only when the SOURCE file is  newer  than  the  destination
              file or when the destination file is missing

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       -x, --one-file-system
              stay on this file system

       -Z     set SELinux security context of destination file to default type

       --context[=CTX]
              like  -Z,  or  if CTX is specified then set the SELinux or SMACK
              security context to CTX

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By default, sparse SOURCE files are detected by a crude  heuristic  and
       the corresponding DEST file is made sparse as well.  That is the behav‐
       ior selected by --sparse=auto.  Specify  --sparse=always  to  create  a
       sparse  DEST  file  whenever  the  SOURCE  file  contains a long enough
       sequence of zero bytes.  Use  --sparse=never  to  inhibit  creation  of
       sparse files.

       When --reflink[=always] is specified, perform a lightweight copy, where
       the data blocks are copied only when modified.  If this is not possible
       the copy fails, or if --reflink=auto is specified, fall back to a stan‐
       dard copy.

       The  backup  suffix  is  '~',  unless  set  with   --suffix   or   SIM‐
       PLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.   The version control method may be selected via the
       --backup option or through the  VERSION_CONTROL  environment  variable.
       Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

       As  a  special  case,  cp  makes  a backup of SOURCE when the force and
       backup options are given and SOURCE and DEST are the same name  for  an
       existing, regular file.

NAME
       touch - change file timestamps

SYNOPSIS
       touch [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Update  the  access  and modification times of each FILE to the current
       time.

       A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c  or  -h
       is supplied.

       A  FILE  argument  string of - is handled specially and causes touch to
       change the times of the file associated with standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are  mandatory  for  short  options
       too.

       -a     change only the access time

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -d, --date=STRING
              parse STRING and use it instead of current time

       -f     (ignored)

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect each symbolic link instead of any referenced file (useful
              only on systems that can change the timestamps of a symlink)

       -m     change only the modification time

       -r, --reference=FILE
              use this file's times instead of current time

       -t STAMP
              use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time

       --time=WORD
              change the specified time: WORD is access, atime, or use: equiv‐
              alent to -a WORD is modify or mtime: equivalent to -m

       --help display this help and exit

       --version

DATE STRING
       The --date=STRING is a mostly free format human  readable  date  string
       such  as  "Sun, 29 Feb 2004 16:21:42 -0800" or "2004-02-29 16:21:42" or
       even "next Thursday".  A date string may contain items indicating  cal‐
       endar  date,  time of day, time zone, day of week, relative time, rela‐
       tive date, and numbers.  An empty string indicates the beginning of the
       day.   The date string format is more complex than is easily documented
       here but is fully described in the info documentation.

NAME
       tr - translate or delete characters

SYNOPSIS
       tr [OPTION]... SET1 [SET2]

DESCRIPTION
       Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input, writ‐
       ing to standard output.

       -c, -C, --complement
              use the complement of SET1

       -d, --delete
              delete characters in SET1, do not translate

       -s, --squeeze-repeats
              replace each input sequence of  a  repeated  character  that  is
              listed in SET1 with a single occurrence of that character

       -t, --truncate-set1
              first truncate SET1 to length of SET2

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       SETs  are  specified  as  strings  of characters.  Most represent them‐
       selves.  Interpreted sequences are:

       \NNN   character with octal value NNN (1 to 3 octal digits)

       \\     backslash

       \a     audible BEL

       \b     backspace

       \f     form feed

       \n     new line

       \r     return

       \t     horizontal tab

       \v     vertical tab

       CHAR1-CHAR2
              all characters from CHAR1 to CHAR2 in ascending order

       [CHAR*]
              in SET2, copies of CHAR until length of SET1

       [CHAR*REPEAT]
              REPEAT copies of CHAR, REPEAT octal if starting with 0

       [:alnum:]
              all letters and digits

       [:alpha:]
              all letters

       [:blank:]
              all horizontal whitespace

       [:cntrl:]
              all control characters

       [:digit:]
              all digits

       [:graph:]
              all printable characters, not including space

       [:lower:]
              all lower case letters

       [:print:]
              all printable characters, including space

       [:punct:]
              all punctuation characters

       [:space:]
              all horizontal or vertical whitespace

       [:upper:]
              all upper case letters

       [:xdigit:]
              all hexadecimal digits

       [=CHAR=]
              all characters which are equivalent to CHAR

       Translation occurs if -d is not given and both SET1  and  SET2  appear.
       -t  may  be  used only when translating.  SET2 is extended to length of
       SET1 by repeating its last character as necessary.   Excess  characters
       of  SET2  are  ignored.  Only [:lower:] and [:upper:] are guaranteed to
       expand in ascending order; used in SET2  while  translating,  they  may
       only  be used in pairs to specify case conversion.  -s uses SET1 if not
       translating nor deleting; else squeezing uses  SET2  and  occurs  after
       translation or deletion.
